## Heading anchor links

All `h2` and `h3` headings now generate clickable anchor links. Hover over any heading to reveal the `#` symbol, click it to update the URL, and share a direct link to that section.

> The best documentation is the one you can link to directly.

## Improved navigation

::::step-group
:::step{title="Doc Switcher"}
A redesigned documentation switcher in the sidebar with descriptions and active state indicators.
:::
:::step{title="Navbar Dropdowns"}
The navbar now supports dropdown menus with icons and descriptions for richer navigation.

## Auto-generated thumbnails

Blog posts and documentation pages now get automatically generated Open Graph thumbnails during build. Powered by Satori, each thumbnail features your project's primary color, the page title, and a clean dark design.

:::callout{variant="success"}
No manual image creation needed — thumbnails are generated at build time and served as static assets.
:::

## Documentation restructuring

The documentation now supports multiple doc collections with a clean switcher. Direct pages at the root of a collection are also supported alongside nested folder structures.

:::codegroup

```txt [Before]
content/
  docs/
    getting-started/
      installation.mdx
      configuration.mdx
```

```txt [After]
content/
  docs/
    framework/
      getting-started/
        installation.mdx
    documentation/
      demo.mdx
```

## Design polish

If you customized the color tokens in your `global.css`, make sure to update them to match the new naming convention.

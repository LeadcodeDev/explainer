# File based routing

Routing is an important part of any content-driven website, allowing you to create dynamic or static pages for your site.

:::callout{variant="info"}
The `blog` and `docs` folders are special collections; they should be considered separate from routing.

## Routing Basics

All of your routes must be defined within the `content/` folder.

:::callout{variant="info"}
Each file representing a new page must be written in markdown format `md` or `mdx`.
:::

Let us consider the desire to create a new `/about` page within our site, we should create an `about` markdown file in the `content/` folder.

:::codegroup

```plain [Url]
https://{hostname}/about
```

```plain [Tree]
├── content/
│ └── about.mdx
```

## Nested Routes

It is possible to create nested routes by creating a folder with the same name as the route in the `content/` folder.
In this example we will create two nested routes `/about` and `/hello/world`.

:::codegroup

```plain [about.mdx]
├── content/
│   └── about/
│      └── index.mdx
```

```plain [world.mdx]
├── content/
│   └── hello/
│      └── world.mdx
```
